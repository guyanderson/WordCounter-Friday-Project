1st - start with word comparison T/F. Easiest because it's only a string to string comparison.
2nd - Break up sentence into words. Push into array. Will need to lookup method to do this.
3rd - loop through array for T/F word matches, collect count. most complex due to requiring more logic than the rest.
4th - nancy app. Not difficult, but backend logic is written first, then interface.
